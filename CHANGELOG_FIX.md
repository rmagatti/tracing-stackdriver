# Changelog - Cloud Trace Integration Fix

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed OpenTelemetry span ID extraction that was causing missing or incorrect trace correlation in Google Cloud Logging
- Logs now properly display the "View trace details" button in Cloud Logging console
- Span IDs are now correctly extracted from the current tracing span instead of parent context
- Fixed fallback logic when `builder.span_id` is not yet available during span initialization

### Changed
- Simplified OpenTelemetry context extraction logic for better reliability
- Improved span ID extraction with proper fallback to `Context::current()`
- Added filtering to exclude remote spans from span ID extraction (prevents using span IDs from other services)
- Trace IDs are now consistently extracted from parent context (correct for distributed tracing)

### Technical Details

#### Before
The previous implementation had complex and fragile logic that:
- Used multiple fallback paths that didn't always work
- Could return `None` for span IDs even when spans existed
- Didn't properly handle the span initialization lifecycle
- Caused logs to be missing trace correlation fields

#### After
The new implementation:
1. **Trace ID**: Extracted from `parent_cx` (propagated through distributed traces)
2. **Span ID**: Primary extraction from `builder.span_id`, with fallback to `Context::current()`
3. **Sampling**: Extracted from parent context (inherits sampling decision)
4. Properly filters out remote spans to ensure only local span IDs are used

### Usage Notes

**Layer ordering is critical!** The OpenTelemetry layer MUST be added BEFORE the Stackdriver layer:

```rust
let subscriber = tracing_subscriber::Registry::default()
    .with(tracing_opentelemetry::layer().with_tracer(tracer))  // FIRST
    .with(tracing_stackdriver::layer().with_cloud_trace(config)); // SECOND
```

### Expected Log Output

Logs now include proper Cloud Trace fields:

```json
{
  "logging.googleapis.com/trace": "projects/your-project/traces/abc123...",
  "logging.googleapis.com/spanId": "def456...",
  "logging.googleapis.com/trace_sampled": true
}
```

### Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ `includes_correct_cloud_trace_fields` test passes
- ✅ `handles_nested_spans` test passes
- ✅ Span IDs are correctly unique per span
- ✅ Trace IDs are correctly propagated

### Compatibility
- `opentelemetry`: 0.29.0+
- `tracing-opentelemetry`: 0.30.0+
- `tracing-subscriber`: 0.3.18+

### Migration Guide

No breaking changes. If you're experiencing issues with trace correlation:

1. Verify layer ordering (OpenTelemetry before Stackdriver)
2. Ensure you're creating spans with `info_span!()` or `debug_span!()`
3. Check that spans are entered before logging
4. For distributed tracing, verify context propagation between services
